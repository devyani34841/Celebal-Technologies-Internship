1. Introduction to Containerization
1.1 What is Containerization?
Containerization is a lightweight form of operating-system-level virtualization that packages an application and all its necessary components—including code, runtime, libraries, system tools, and configuration files—into a self-contained, isolated unit called a container. This unit is designed to run consistently and reliably across various computing environments, from a developer's local machine to on-premises servers, virtual machines, or cloud platforms.

1.2 Benefits of Containerization
Containerization addresses the common "it works on my machine" dilemma by ensuring environmental consistency. Its primary advantages include:

Portability: Containers encapsulate all dependencies, enabling applications to be built once and run uniformly across any compatible environment.

Consistency: Guarantees that applications behave identically across development, testing, staging, and production environments.

Isolation: Each container operates in an isolated environment, preventing conflicts between applications or their dependencies. The failure of one container does not impact others.

Efficiency: Containers share the host operating system's kernel, making them significantly lighter and faster to provision and start than traditional Virtual Machines (VMs), leading to optimized resource utilization.

Scalability: Containers can be rapidly scaled up or down to meet fluctuating demand, particularly when managed by orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.

Faster Deployment: The standardized and isolated nature of containers streamlines Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, facilitating quicker and more reliable software deployments.

2. Docker Fundamentals
Docker is the leading open-source platform designed to facilitate the development, shipment, and execution of applications within containers. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for managing the entire container lifecycle.

2.1 Key Docker Concepts
Dockerfile: A plain text file that contains a sequence of instructions (commands) for building a Docker image. It acts as a reproducible script for creating container environments.

Docker Image: A read-only, immutable template that contains a complete, executable package of software. It includes the application code, a runtime, system libraries, environment variables, and configuration files required for the application to run. Images are built from Dockerfiles.

Docker Container: A runnable instance of a Docker image. When an image is executed, it becomes a container, providing an isolated, portable environment where the application runs. Containers can be started, stopped, paused, and removed.

Docker Registry (e.g., Docker Hub): A centralized repository service where Docker images can be stored, managed, and shared publicly or privately. Docker Hub is the default public registry, hosting numerous official and community-contributed images.

Docker Daemon (dockerd): A persistent background process that runs on the host system. It listens for Docker API requests and manages Docker objects such as images, containers, networks, and volumes.

Docker Client (docker CLI): The command-line interface (CLI) that users interact with to send commands to the Docker Daemon, initiating container operations.

2.2 Docker Architecture
Docker operates on a client-server architecture. The Docker client communicates with the Docker daemon, which is responsible for executing the commands and managing Docker objects.

                       | Docker Objects    |
                       | (Images, Containers,|
                       | Networks, Volumes)  |
                       +-------------------+

3. Basic Docker Commands
This section lists fundamental Docker commands essential for managing images and containers.

docker --version: Displays the installed Docker client and engine version.

docker info: Provides detailed system-wide information about Docker, including statistics on containers, images, and other Docker configurations.

docker pull <image_name>[:<tag>]: Downloads a Docker image from a specified registry (defaults to Docker Hub). If no <tag> is provided, latest is assumed.

Example: docker pull ubuntu:22.04

docker images: Lists all Docker images stored locally on your system.

docker rmi <image_id_or_name>[:<tag>]: Removes one or more Docker images from local storage. The -f or --force option can be used to override warnings about in-use images.

Example: docker rmi my-app-image:1.0

docker run [OPTIONS] <image_name>[:<tag>] [COMMAND] [ARG...]: Creates and starts a new container from a specified Docker image. Key options include:

-d (detached mode): Runs the container in the background.

-p <host_port>:<container_port>: Maps a port from the host machine to a port inside the container.

--name <container_name>: Assigns a custom, human-readable name to the container.

-it (interactive TTY): Allocates a pseudo-TTY and keeps STDIN open, allowing for interactive sessions (e.g., shell access).

Example (run Nginx in detached mode, port mapping): docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name my-webserver nginx

Example (run interactive Ubuntu shell): docker run -it ubuntu bash

docker ps: Lists all currently running Docker containers.

docker ps -a: Lists all Docker containers, including those that have stopped.

docker stop <container_id_or_name>: Gracefully stops one or more running containers.

Example: docker stop my-webserver

docker start <container_id_or_name>: Starts one or more stopped containers.

Example: docker start my-webserver

docker restart <container_id_or_name>: Restarts one or more containers.

docker rm <container_id_or_name>: Removes one or more stopped containers. Use -f for forced removal of running containers.

Example: docker rm my-webserver

docker exec [OPTIONS] <container_id_or_name> <command>: Executes a command inside a running container. Often used with -it for interactive sessions.

Example: docker exec -it my-webserver bash

docker logs <container_id_or_name>: Retrieves and displays the logs generated by a container. Use -f to follow logs in real-time.

Example: docker logs -f my-webserver

docker inspect <object_id_or_name>: Returns low-level information on Docker objects (containers, images, networks, volumes).

Example: docker inspect my-webserver

docker build -t <image_name>[:<tag>] <path_to_dockerfile>: Builds a new Docker image from a Dockerfile. The . typically refers to the current directory containing the Dockerfile.

Example: docker build -t my-python-app:v1.0 .
